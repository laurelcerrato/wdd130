    <h2>Laurel Cerrato</h2>
    <p>Hello!, My name is Laurel Xiomara Cerrato Ramirez, I just turned 18 years old, the career I'm studying is Bachelor in Applied Technology, something I love to do is sing, I've always been that girl who is singing everywhere and everyone shushes her haha, I guess music is in my blood, My father and my 3 older brothers are musicians, they play instruments, I wasn't left behind, I took piano and violin lessons when I was little, but instruments weren't my thing, singing was my thing, unfortunately I couldn't take singing lessons, so now I'm focusing on something else that I also really like! My career. Studies are very important to me, when I think about my future I always hope to improve my skills by learning as much as possible.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church since I was born, I am very grateful to be able to know the gospel, it has helped me a lot in the good and bad moments of my life, probably one of the moments in which I have been more grateful for the plan of salvation and the gospel was when my father passed away, it was something devastating for me, but to know that families can be eternal and to know that I can see him again is something that always makes me feel better. I testify that his gospel is true, that he loves us and that everything he does is perfect.</p>
